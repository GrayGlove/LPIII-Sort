# PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE III - ORDERING METHODS

The following ordering methods were implemented:
- BubbleSort
- InsertionSort
- SelectionSort
- QuickSort

TESTING
===========
- Tests were carried out with vectors of size 10 raised to n, where 0<n<8.
- The vectors were filled with pseudo-random data.
- Tests were carried out with the four ordering methods for the same vector.
- The ordering time for these vectors was measured, which can be seen in the following table and graphs.

| Vector Size | BubbleSort | InsertionSort | SelectionSort | QuickSort |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| 10 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 100 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| 1000 | 0.003 | 0.001 | 0.001 | 0 |
| 10000 | 0.364 | 0.127 | 0.125 | 0 |
| 100000 | 35.228 | 11.595 | 12.646 | 0.005 |
| 1000000 | 4386.5 | 1454.58 | 1536 | 0.079 |
